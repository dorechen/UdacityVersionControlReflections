Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
A: When you want to share your work, or when you are working with other 
people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: With manual pulls, you will know when your repository is updated and 
you will know what state it's in. If it updates automatically, you might 
not know what your files look like, it could get confusing.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are when you want to make a clone of someone else's 
repository in their Github into your own Github account. You would use 
this when you don't have permission to edit or contribute to the 
author's repository, but you want to make your own cahnges.
Clones are copies of a repository, this will also copy all the commits 
that were made. You would use this to copy a repository from Github 
to a local repository, or from one computer to another(?).
Branches are used when you want to try experimental changes, but you 
don't want in the main file.
