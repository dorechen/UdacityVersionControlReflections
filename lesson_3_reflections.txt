Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
A: When you want to share your work, or when you are working with other 
people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: With manual pulls, you will know when your repository is updated and 
you will know what state it's in. If it updates automatically, you might 
not know what your files look like, it could get confusing.
