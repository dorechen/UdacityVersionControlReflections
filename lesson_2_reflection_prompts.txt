Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?
A: It turns your folder into a git repository. It starts out as an 
empty git reposotory. You need to initialise it to start recording commits.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The working directory is where your files are stored. The staging 
area is where you can add a file, with changes, that you want to be 
committed. 

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?
A: You can choose which file to commit by adding it to the staging 
area first, and then using diff --staged, check with the last commit 
before commiting. This way you can ensure that each commit is logical.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?
A: Branches can be used for when you want to try a new feature but want 
to keep it separate from the main version. This way, you can develop on 
the new feature without disturbing the main working version, at the 
same time you can keep working on the main version.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: The diagrams clearly show how each commit is linked with its parent. 
It also shows how a commit may be lost if it is unreachable and doesn't 
have a branch label.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A: Merging two branches combines the two files together, so the new 
file should have the features of both. The diagram shows which 
commits were made before merging each branch and where the branch 
started.

Q: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always 
doing merges manually?
A: Auto merging can save a lot of time for the user, but it might 
not always merge the way you want it to (if some parts aren't detected 
as a conflict and it combines the file weirdly). Doing it manually 
can mean that you always merge them the way you want it to.
