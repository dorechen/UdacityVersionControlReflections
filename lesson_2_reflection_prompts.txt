Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?
A: It turns your folder into a git repository. It starts out as an 
empty git reposotory. You need to initialise it to start recording commits.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The working directory is where your files are stored. The staging 
area is where you can add a file, with changes, that you want to be 
committed.
